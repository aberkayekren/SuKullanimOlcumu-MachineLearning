# Water Usage Measurement - Machine Learning

This project involves a water usage measurement application that utilizes machine learning techniques to measure water usage. The project employs data science and machine learning methods to predict and analyze water usage.

## The Project


The purpose of this project is to utilize machine learning methods to measure and analyze water usage. The sustainability and efficient utilization of water resources are important issues. The project aims to provide a solution to this problem by using machine learning algorithms to predict and optimize water usage.

The project can be used to predict water usage for a household or a business. The dataset used in the project contains factors that affect water consumption. For example, each data sample in the dataset includes a timestamp value (in milliseconds since the birth of Jesus) and the corresponding water consumption value.

Essentially, the project involves the following components:

Data Collection: Sensors or measurement devices are used to collect water usage data.
Data Processing: The collected data is formatted in a way suitable for machine learning algorithms.
Machine Learning: Machine learning algorithms are applied to the dataset to create a model for predicting water usage.
Analysis and Results: The performance of the created model is evaluated, and the results are analyzed.
