# Why Linear Regression

This project was conducted to estimate water usage using the linear regression method to measure water use.

This project aims to use machine learning methods to predict and analyze water usage. Sustainability and effective use of water resources is an important issue. In this project, linear regression model was preferred to measure and analyze water use.

Linear regression is a basic method of regression and is a model often used in simple estimation problems, such as water use estimation. The reasons for preferring linear regression in the project may be as follows:

- Simplicity: Linear regression is a basic regression method that is easy to understand and apply. It can be preferred at the beginning stage of the project or when there is a need for a simple estimate.

- Linear Relationship: If the assumption of a linear relationship between water consumption and some factors is valid, linear regression can give accurate results. For example, there may be a linear relationship between water consumption and the hour.

- Ease of Intervention: Linear regression models allow the parameters and coefficients of the model to be easily interpreted. This makes it easier to understand what factors water use is associated with and to make inferences.

Other regression models (e.g., polynomial regression, nonlinear regression) can capture more complex relationships, but sometimes require more data or more processing. It may have been thought that linear regression was sufficient in the project and provided the expected results.

# Why Other Regression Models Are Not Used:

- Logistic Regression: Logistic regression is a model used for classification problems, utilizing the sigmoid function to capture non-linear relationships. It may not have been preferred because the target variable in the dataset is continuous and requires classification instead of regression. However, depending on the project requirements, logistic regression can be a viable option to consider.
- Ridge Regression: It may not be preferred unless there is excessive multicollinearity in the dataset or regularization is necessary.
- Lasso Regression: It can be used if there are a small number of significant features in the dataset or if feature selection is desired.
- Elastic Net Regression: It combines the advantages of Lasso and Ridge regression, but it may not be preferred when feature selection is not needed or there are only a few features.
- Polynomial Regression: It can be used in cases where the data exhibits complex relationships. However, it may add unnecessary complexity if linear regression is sufficient.
- Support Vector Regression: It is a model that can capture non-linear relationships. However, it can be computationally expensive if the dataset is high-dimensional or has a large number of features.
- Decision Tree Regression: It can be prone to overfitting due to its branching and merging steps.
- Random Forest Regression: It is a model that consists of many decision trees combined together. It can have disadvantages such as high computational cost and a tendency to overfit.
- Gradient Boosting Regression: It creates weak learners sequentially with error-correcting steps. It can have high computational cost and require tuning of hyperparameters.
- Bagging Regression: It is a model that combines multiple decision trees with bootstrap sampling. It can reduce overfitting tendencies in the dataset but still has high computational cost.
- AdaBoost Regression: It creates weak learners sequentially by emphasizing misclassified examples. It is sensitive to noise in the dataset and requires tuning of hyperparameters.
- Artificial Neural Network Regression: It is a deep learning model that can capture complex relationships. However, it can have a tendency to overfit and high computational cost if the dataset is small or limited resources are available.
- K-Nearest Neighbors Regression: It works by making predictions around the neighboring points. It can be sensitive to noise and outliers in the dataset.
- Gaussian Process Regression: It is a model that captures high variations in the examined points. However, it can be computationally expensive for large datasets.
- Relevance Vector Regression: It is a model that works by randomly selecting a subset. It can be preferred for large datasets and when quick results are needed.
- Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA): It is used to model time series data. It may not be preferred when the dataset is not a time series or there are no specific requirements.
- XGBoost Regression: It is an optimized implementation of the gradient boosting algorithm. It can have high computational cost and require tuning of hyperparameters.
- LightGBM Regression: It is a fast implementation of the gradient boosting algorithm. However, it can have high memory usage in very large datasets.
- CatBoost Regression: It is a gradient boosting algorithm that can automatically handle categorical variables. It may require computational cost and tuning of hyperparameters.
- Neuro-Fuzzy Regression: It is a combination of fuzzy logic and artificial neural networks. Its usage can be complex and require tuning of hyperparameters.
