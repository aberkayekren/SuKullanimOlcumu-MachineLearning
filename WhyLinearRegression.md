# Why Linear Regression

This project was conducted to estimate water usage using the linear regression method to measure water use.

This project aims to use machine learning methods to predict and analyze water usage. Sustainability and effective use of water resources is an important issue. In this project, linear regression model was preferred to measure and analyze water use.

Linear regression is a basic method of regression and is a model often used in simple estimation problems, such as water use estimation. The reasons for preferring linear regression in the project may be as follows:

- Simplicity: Linear regression is a basic regression method that is easy to understand and apply. It can be preferred at the beginning stage of the project or when there is a need for a simple estimate.

- Linear Relationship: If the assumption of a linear relationship between water consumption and some factors is valid, linear regression can give accurate results. For example, there may be a linear relationship between water consumption and the hour.

- Ease of Intervention: Linear regression models allow the parameters and coefficients of the model to be easily interpreted. This makes it easier to understand what factors water use is associated with and to make inferences.

Other regression models (e.g., polynomial regression, nonlinear regression) can capture more complex relationships, but sometimes require more data or more processing. It may have been thought that linear regression was sufficient in the project and provided the expected results.
